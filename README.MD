# Graphics programming practice

This is my little laboratory with which I learn OpenGL and OpenCV (yes, both together) to study CG.

The base of this project had been done with help of the [TheCherno's OpenGL tutorial](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2).

Other resources I've use:
- [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com)
- [OpenGL Programming Wikibook](wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming)
- [OpenCV docs](docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html)
- [LearnOpenCV](learnopencv.com/getting-started-with-opencv/)
